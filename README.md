`shjs` binary, formerly distributed as part of
[ShellJS](https://github.com/shelljs/shelljs).

```sh
npm install -g shelljs-shjs
```

**Note:** this package is published as `shelljs-shjs`, not as `shjs`.

## Maintenance mode

While this package is not explicitly deprecated, this is in maintenance mode. If
you want to execute ShellJS scripts, just use the `node` command (or whatever is
appropriate for the language of the script, ex. `coffee`).

This package was removed from ShellJS to reduce that module's dependencies and
to shrink overall download size.
